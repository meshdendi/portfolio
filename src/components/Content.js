            <p> I have 2 years of experience as an Oracle developer and 1 year as a software developer. 
                I have worked on many projects mainly in the banking sector, developing financial solutions 
                for money markets, loans, and saving accounts modules.
            </p>
            <p> I am also a proficient Java developer, building scalable full stack solutions using latest web technologies. 
                My strong suit is in solving customer business problems and ensuring they receive a robust 
                and satisfying solution.

            <h4>Projects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Database migration:</strong> Migrated a whole banking system from the legacy Oracle 6i database to Oracle 12c. Upgraded
                their binary files from forms 6i to 12c and optimizing many of their existing solutions.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Developed an interface for a large bank. This interface would consume a SOAP api, verify data integrity
                and apply many business rules to each and every operation received. This interface proved to be reliable and error 
                resistant, consuming thousands or operations daily in an insignificant amount of time.
